# blackjack

This is a personal project I developed as a result of a sequence of experiments in React. From writing a componment that would render a playing card from a given suit and value, to an algorithm to shuffle a deck of cards and render a full deck in a shuffled order, to using these assets to create simple card games. Higher / Lower was an early effort, and then this browser version of Blackjack (or 21 if you prefer).  This most recent iteration was adapting the code from player Vs player, to player Vs computer by automating the dealer hand to play according to standard casino rules. This is a simplified version of Blackjack with only options to twist or stick - splitting is not implemented yet. 

One of the major hurdles I overcame was dealing with stale data in the game state, which I solved with the useMemo hook. To try for yourself the game is hosted at the following URL
